Amazing Code!

Hello, my name is Márcio Gemelli, I am 41 years old and I am passionate about transformation and evolution. My journey began as a hairstyle and visagist, where I gained extensive experience in creating unique and personalized styles, always enhancing the beauty and individuality of each client.

I spent a considerable time living in Europe, where I had the opportunity to expand my horizons and gain new perspectives. Now, I am back in Brazil, living in São Paulo, and I continue my relentless pursuit of growth and innovation.

During the pandemic, I discovered a new passion: programming. Since then, I have immersed myself in this universe, constantly learning and challenging myself. This journey has led me to explore and specialize in incredible areas such as Artificial Intelligence, UX, programming, and full stack development.

Now, I am determined to combine my creativity and technical skills to make a difference in the tech world. I believe that my diverse experience allows me to bring a unique and innovative perspective to every project I am involved in.
